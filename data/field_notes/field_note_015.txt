Summary: Partner check-in completed. Severity rating (1–5): 2.

Context note: Recent heatwaves have been more frequent than last year, affecting work hours and community attendance.

Key observations:
- participation in training sessions is lower than expected. Estimated schedule impact: ~4 weeks.
- right-of-way approvals are incomplete for the planned alignment.
- Note: partner also reported 'no material delays' this month, which conflicts with the observed status.
- Budget note: indicative cost pressure of ~11.8% versus plan (not yet approved).

Mitigation actions proposed:
- Run targeted engagement; incorporate feedback; use trusted community intermediaries.
- Provide compliance support; maintain regulator touchpoints; prepare alternate alignments.

Next steps:
- Confirm revised workplan and milestones in writing.
