Dataset package: Clear Trend Version (Simplified)

Designed to be solvable within 72 hours.
Key intentional properties:
- Clear upward trend in heat indicators from 2021 to 2024 (heat_index and heatwave_days).
- Mild upward trend in flood indicators in flood-prone districts.
- Project delivery improves modestly over time (learning effect), partly offset by climate disruption.
- Small, realistic data issues remain (minor join formatting issues; a small amount of missingness; one outlier).
